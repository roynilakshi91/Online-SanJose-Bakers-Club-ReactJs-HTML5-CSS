            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p> For many baking &#129473; &#127850; is a kind of a hobby or a passion and they keep baking goods &#127856; at home but for some beginners it can be hard to start as it needs a bit of preparation and techniques. So here we are welcoming to to this baking club where a group of people who gather together on a regular or semi-regular basis to explore or learn baking. An amateur baker as well as any professionals are most welcome in this group. Along with traditional recipes, we don't hesitate to try out new recipes and baking techniques every week. The main reason is that there is enormous fun where a group of people gather together, roll up their sleeves and get something delicious done.  </p>
            <h3> How this works?</h3>
            <p>The Baking Club meets once a month to try out new recipes and baking techniques.There is no membership requirement for this class.This club is an open environment, where people from this community can register themselves and book a slot every week for the in-person class to share a love for baking and can exchange personal recipes. Upcoming recipes for the week will be posted on the website and according to that you can choose your slot. We encourage you to send us new recipes as well.You can mail us here: newrecipes@creativebakers.com. You are not welcome to bring baking goods at home. During our get-together we share and taste each others baked goods and enjoy.
            </p>
